# PsyChrome's DTM User Script

A user script that automates the game Downtown Mafia. 

## Features

1. Working:

	* Automatically commits crimes when the crime mode is set to auto. This will attempt to commit the highest available crime and move on as and when new crimes unlock.
	* Manually commits crimes when the crime mode is set to manual. You can then specify which crime you would like to commit.

2. To do:

	* A completionist mode that will go through and master each crime available.
	* Jail busting module - Maybe.
